# book_meal
The pages elaborate on the UI for the book a meal application as relected on my github repository at https://github.com/chepmanu/book_meal. The pages can be navigated from the point of a caterer or a user which offer different features for the two. Some fundamental features cut across both sides such as going back to the same index page and options for loging out of the systme.
